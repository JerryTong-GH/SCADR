For detailed installation instructions, please refer to the documentation.</p> <p>Before installing SCADR, please ensure that the following MATLAB add-on toolboxes are installed. These can be downloaded for free via the Add-On Explorer within MATLAB:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Image Processing Toolbox (v22.2 or newer)</p> </li> <li> <p>Mapping Toolbox (v22.2 or newer)</p> </li> <li> <p>Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox (v22.2 or newer)</p> </li> </ul> <p>There are two ways of using SCADR: 1. Open the SCADR.mlapp file located in the Development Files folder.   In MATLAB, ensure all relevant folders are added to the path:   Use the Current Folder panel on the left side.   Right-click each required folder and select \"Add to Path\" &gt; \"Selected Folders and Subfolders\".</p> <ol> <li>SCADR installation file is located in the Installation Files directory on the main page.
