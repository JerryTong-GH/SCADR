# SCADR (Single Cell Analytics for Dose Response) 

Currently editing in progress

## Overview
The `SCADR` library analyzes dose-dependent single-cell phosphoprotein profiles from flow cytometry data. It is focuses on capturing the phosphoprotein profile of each cell so as to examine the impact of gene expression on signaling pathways at a single cell level. 

## Features
- **Single Cell Resolution**: SCADR analyzes individual cell data rather than population medians, capturing subtle functional differences between variants.
- **Dose-response Analysis**: SCADR links protein expression levels (e.g., from HA-tagged constructs) to downstream signaling outputs using smooth regression methods (e.g., rLOESS).
- **Multiparameter Profiling**: SCADR supports simultaneous assessment of multiple phosphoproteins (e.g., pAKT, pS6, pERK, pCREB, pp38) within each cell.
- **Variant Classification**: SCADR distinguishes the functional impacts of gene variants (e.g., PTEN missense mutations) on canonical and non-canonical signaling pathways.
- **Pairwise Correlation and Heatmaps**: SCADR quantifies co-regulation and signaling cross-talk between phosphoproteins, useful for identifying mechanistic insights and variant clustering.
- **Data Transformation**: SCADR includes commonly used algorithms for data transformation such as PCA, t-SNE, UMAP, and bi-exp scaling, improving visualization and interpretation of variant-specific signaling signatures in flow cytometry data with a wide dynamic range.

## Installation (to be done)
SCADR requires MatLab with > 2022b version. The software might be able to run on older versions but integrity of the software cannot be ensured. 
The following list of add-on library need to be installed before the installation of the program itself. These can be found in the add-on tab in MatLab and all library used in the software are free to be installed.
- Curve Fitting Toolbox (ver. 22.2 or newer)
- Data Acquisition Toolbox (ver. 22.2 or newer)
- Image Processing Toolbox (ver. 22.2 or newer)
- Mapping Toolbox (ver. 22.2 or newer)
- Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox (ver. 22.2 or newer)

The installation file can be found in App Installation File directory from the main page. Follow the instructions on screen to complete the installation.

Default installations include the first dataset used for the paper "Multiplex phosphoflow analysis with a single-cell dosage response platform (SCADR) facilitates deciphering lipid and protein phosphatase â€“ dependent PTEN functions". Some of the results in the paper are listed in the demo section.

## Pull Request and Usage

Pull requests are welcome. Please report bugs, as we're still refining this library over time.
