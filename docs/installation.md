## Installation 

The software may still run on earlier versions of MATLAB; however, full functionality and stability cannot be guaranteed if older versions of add-ons/matlab are used. 

All installation tests have been conducted using MATLAB version 2022b or later. Before installing SCADR, please ensure that the following MATLAB add-on toolboxes are installed. These can be downloaded for free via the Add-On Explorer within MATLAB:

- *Image Processing Toolbox* (v22.2 or newer)

- *Mapping Toolbox* (v22.2 or newer)

- *Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox* (v22.2 or newer)

There are two ways of using/installing SCADR:

# Using SCADR as a Developer

This version of installation allows you to interact with the SCADR code more, meaning that the user can modify and change
Open the SCADR.mlapp file located in the Development Files folder.
  In MATLAB, ensure all relevant folders are added to the path:
  Use the Current Folder panel on the left side.
  Right-click each required folder and select "Add to Path" > "Selected Folders and Subfolders".

# Using SCADR as a General User
2. SCADR installation file is located in the Installation Files directory on the main page. Follow the on-screen prompts to complete the installation process. To ensure a complete installation, please run the .exe installation file as an administrator.

By default, SCADR includes the dataset used in the publication:
“Multiplex phosphoflow analysis with a single-cell dosage response platform (SCADR) facilitates deciphering lipid and protein phosphatase–dependent PTEN functions.”
Several figures from this study are available in the Demo section for reference.
