The 3D Function Plot in SCADR visualizes how a specific phosphoprotein’s abundance changes across a range of expression levels for two different transfected proteins simultaneously. This allows users to examine the combined effect of two variables on downstream signaling activity.

It fits a response surface using nonparametric regression (e.g., LOESS) and displays the result as a smooth 3D surface, helping reveal synergistic, additive, or opposing interactions between the two transfected proteins. Users can rotate and zoom the plot for better spatial interpretation.
