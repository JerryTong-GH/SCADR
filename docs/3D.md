The 3D Function Plots in SCADR visualize how the abundance of a specific phosphoprotein changes in response to varying expression levels of two transfected proteins simultaneously. This enables users to examine the combined influence of two independent variables on downstream signaling activity.

Note: The 3D plot functionality under the 1-3D Plot tab is still under development. This section will be updated once that feature is complete.

## 1-3D Plot
SCADR provides a variety of plot types for single-cell data visualization. These options can be accessed by clicking the **2D Plot Setting button**. The four available plot types are described below:

1. Scatter Plot
The Scatter Plot offers a straightforward way to examine the relationship between two variables. Each point corresponds to a single cell, where the x-axis shows the expression level of a transfected gene and the y-axis displays the intensity of a downstream phosphoprotein marker.

2. Bin Scatter Plot
The Bin Scatter Plot segments the x-axis (expression levels) into user-defined intervals (bins), and then calculates a summary statistic (typically the mean or median) for the marker intensity within each bin.

3. 3D Histogram
The 3D Histogram extends the concept of binning into two dimensions:

X-axis: Expression level

Y-axis: Marker intensity

Z-axis (height): The frequency of cells within each bin - this provides a comprehensive view of data distribution across both axes

4. Bin Bar Plot
The Bin Bar Plot presents a bar chart summarizing marker intensity values (mean, median, or quantiles) for each expression bin. This plot simplifies interpretation by reducing the data into clean, digestible bar segments.

Each of these visualization types helps users investigate how transgene expression relates to downstream signaling activity in single cells. They are designed to handle varying levels of noise, outliers, and data density, offering flexibility for interpreting complex single-cell phosphoproteomic datasets.

## 3D Plot on 2D
The 3D Plot on 2D in SCADR represents three-dimensional single-cell data in a 2D format, using circle size to convey the third dimension. Rather than using depth or color, the size of each circle reflects the cell count within a specific data region. This approach allows users to simultaneously examine relationships between expression and phosphoprotein intensity along with frequency.

Plot Structure:

X-axis: Expression level of the transfected protein

Y-axis: Intensity of the selected downstream marker

Z-axis (circle size): Number of cells within each expression–intensity bin - larger circles indicate higher cell density in that region.
