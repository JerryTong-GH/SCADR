Since transfection often results in variable expression levels across individual cells, SCADR takes advantage of this heterogeneity by tracking how changes in protein abundance (e.g., from a transfected gene) affect the levels of downstream phosphoproteins. By linking the expression of specific genes to signaling outputs, SCADR generates dose-response curves that reflect how the functional activity of a gene variant behaves across a range of expression levels. This enables a more nuanced and dynamic understanding of how protein variants impact intracellular signaling pathways in real time, at the single-cell level.</p> <p>SCADR includes standard regression models such as rLOESS to reveal subtle functional differences among gene variants. It also provides traditional analytical metrics like median fluorescence intensity (MFI), as well as single-cell\u2013based correlation analysis to uncover relationships between phosphoproteins. The tool offers built-in filtering options and supports multiple dimensionality reduction techniques\u2014including PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP\u2014along with biexponential transformations for visual clarity. These features allow users to identify signaling cross-talk, uncover variant-specific profiles, and explore complex cellular phenotypes through correlation heatmaps and clustering.</p>"},{"location":"#get-started","title":"Get Started","text":"<ul> <li>Installation</li> <li>Modules</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#example-output","title":"Example Output","text":"<ul> <li>Examples</li> </ul> <p>\u00a9 Copyright 2025, Jerry Tong, Corbin Glufka</p>"},{"location":"13D/","title":"1-3D Plot","text":"<p>The 3D Function Plot in SCADR visualizes how a specific phosphoprotein\u2019s abundance changes across a range of expression levels for two different transfected proteins simultaneously.
