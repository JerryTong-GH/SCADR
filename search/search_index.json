Since transfection often results in variable expression levels across individual cells, SCADR takes advantage of this heterogeneity by tracking how changes in protein abundance (e.g., from a transfected gene) affect the levels of downstream phosphoproteins. By linking the expression of specific genes to signaling outputs, SCADR generates dose-response curves that reflect how the functional activity of a gene variant behaves across a range of expression levels. This enables a more nuanced and dynamic understanding of how protein variants impact intracellular signaling pathways in real time, at the single-cell level.</p> <p>SCADR includes standard regression models such as rLOESS to reveal subtle functional differences among gene variants. It also provides traditional analytical metrics like median fluorescence intensity (MFI), as well as single-cell\u2013based correlation analysis to uncover relationships between phosphoproteins. The tool offers built-in filtering options and supports multiple dimensionality reduction techniques\u2014including PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP\u2014along with biexponential transformations for visual clarity. These features allow users to identify signaling cross-talk, uncover variant-specific profiles, and explore complex cellular phenotypes through correlation heatmaps and clustering.</p>"},{"location":"installation/","title":"Installation","text":""},{"location":"installation/#installation","title":"Installation","text":"<p>The software may still run on earlier versions of MATLAB; however, full functionality and stability cannot be guaranteed if older versions of add-ons/matlab are used. </p> <p>All installation tests have been conducted using MATLAB version 2022b or later.

It is ideal for users who want a stable, ready-to-use version of the software without the risk of unintentionally breaking any functionality. While code editing is not supported in this mode, the installation is more secure and can be easily reinstalled if needed. Steps: 1. Navigate to the Installation Files directory on the main page of the SCADR repository. 2. Double-click on the SCADR_Installer. 3. Follow the on-screen prompts to complete the installation process. Note: For a successful installation, it is recommended to run the installer as an administrator.</p>"},{"location":"installation/#licensing-and-contribution","title":"Licensing and Contribution","text":"<p>SCADR is protected by copyright.
